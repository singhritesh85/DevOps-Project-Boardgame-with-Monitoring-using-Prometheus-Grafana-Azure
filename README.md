This DevOps project aims to create the infrastructure for the project using terraform, establish the end-to-end CI/CD setup and its monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana (Prometheus and Grafana used as Monitoring Tool in this project). Azure DevOps Pipeline was used as CI/CD Tool. For Code Quality check SonarQube, to keep the Artifacts Azure Artifacts Feed and Maven was used as a Build Tool. Trivy was used as a Security Scanning tool, Docker Image was stored in ACR (Azure Container Registries) and for deployment Helm had been used. The high-level architecture diagram for the project is as shown above.

Prometheus and Grafana had been used as monitoring tool for this project. Node-Exporter will extract the metrics from the Azure DevOps Agent, SonarQube-Server, Prometheus Server, Blackbox-Exporter Server, Grafana-Server and AKS Cluster and send to the Prometheus Server. I had installed Blackbox Exporter on a different server and not on the Prometheus Server. Prometheus blackbox operator is used for endpoint monitoring (Synthetic Monitoring) across the protocol http, https, TCP and ICMP. In this project I am monitoring the Application URL https://boardgame.singhritesh85.com with the help of Prometheus Blackbox-Exporter. Prometheus blackbox exporter will send the metrics to Prometheus. For this project Prometheus acts as a DataSource for Grafana and send metrics to Grafana which we can see with the help of Charts and Graphs.
